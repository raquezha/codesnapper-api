# üñºÔ∏è Code Snapper ‚Äî Project Context

## üöÄ Purpose
Code Snapper is a web-based Kotlin app that converts code input into beautiful, shareable images with syntax highlighting. It also exposes an API so other tools or services can use it.

## üß∞ Tech Stack
- Language: Kotlin
- Framework: Ktor (Web + REST API)
- Build Tool: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
- Dependency Injection: Koin 3.5.6
- Syntax Highlighting: Highlights JVM 1.0.0
- Output: PNG (or SVG) image
- Optional Renderer: Java2D or headless Chromium

## üì¶ API Overview

### Endpoint
`POST /snap`

### Request Payload (JSON)
```json
{
  "code": "fun hello() = println(\"Hello\")",
  "language": "kotlin",
  "theme": "dark"
}
```

### Response
Returns a syntax-highlighted image of the provided code.  
Content-Type: `image/png` or `image/svg+xml`

## üìù Goals
- Generate beautiful code images from raw text input
- Accept multiple languages and themes
- Make it API-first (frontend optional)
- Lightweight and fast

## ‚úÖ TODOs
- [x] Implement POST /snap endpoint in Ktor
- [x] Parse JSON payload: code, language, theme
- [x] Integrate a syntax highlighter (library or headless browser)

> ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: The Highlights library is fully integrated in the /snap endpoint. Incoming code, language, theme, and darkMode are parsed and highlighted using the correct Highlights Builder API. The HighlightsCodeHighlighterService now produces real syntax highlight tokens (no longer a dummy implementation) and returns properly formatted HTML with color styling.

- [x] Fix: HTML output for syntax highlighting now correctly matches code structure and order (no duplicate or misplaced tokens). The highlightsToHtml function sorts highlights and processes each region only once.
- [x] Support multiple languages and themes

> ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Supported languages and themes are documented in README.md. The /snap endpoint validates both fields and returns HTTP 400 for unsupported values, ensuring robust API behavior. All utility functions (parseSyntaxLanguage, parseSyntaxTheme) are now properly utilized.

- [x] Clean Architecture implementation completed

> ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: All layers are properly implemented - domain models (CodeSnippet, HighlightedCode), service interfaces (CodeHighlighterService), use cases (HighlightCodeUseCase), infrastructure (HighlightsCodeHighlighterService), and controllers (SnapRequest). The HighlightsCodeHighlighterService now uses the real Highlights library API instead of returning empty lists.

- [x] Dependency Injection with Koin

> ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Koin DI is fully integrated with Clean Architecture. All dependencies are managed through the `appModule` in `/di/AppModule.kt`. The routing layer uses `inject<HighlightCodeUseCase>()` instead of manual instantiation, making the code more testable and maintainable. Koin is configured with SLF4J logging for better debugging.

- [ ] Render highlighted code as PNG (or SVG)
- [ ] Return image with correct Content-Type
- [ ] Validate input and handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests for the endpoint
- [ ] Add download/preview URL
- [ ] Implement rate limiting or usage tracking
- [ ] Build a frontend playground
- [ ] Add pastebin-like history

## üå± Future Features (Nice to have)
- Download link or preview URL
- Rate limiting or usage tracking
- Frontend playground (optional)
- Pastebin-like history (temporary or persistent)

## ü§ñ AI Notes
Use this file as context when writing, refactoring, or generating features. Always keep the API shape consistent and make image output the core priority.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles for maintainability and testability:

- **domain/model/**: Core business models (e.g., CodeSnippet, HighlightedCode)
- **domain/service/**: Business logic interfaces (e.g., CodeHighlighterService)
- **usecase/**: Application-specific use cases (e.g., HighlightCodeUseCase)
- **infrastructure/**: Implementations of interfaces, integrations (e.g., HighlightsCodeHighlighterService)
- **adapter/controller/**: HTTP layer, DTOs (e.g., SnapRequest)
- **di/**: Dependency injection configuration (Koin modules)
- **Routing.kt**: Ktor routing/controllers, delegates to use cases

**Dependency Injection with Koin:**
All dependencies are managed through Koin DI container. The `appModule` defines singleton instances for services and use cases. Controllers use `inject<T>()` to receive dependencies, ensuring loose coupling and testability.

This separation ensures the core logic is independent of frameworks and easy to test, extend, or swap out. See the codebase for concrete examples.
