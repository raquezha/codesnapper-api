## Production Deployment

### Docker Deployment

Code Snapper API is designed for containerized deployment, making it perfect for:

**Automation Workflows** Integrate with n8n, Zapier, or custom automation tools
**Bot Integration** Generate images for Telegram, Discord, or Slack bots
**Zero-Ops Hosting** Deploy to Railway, Render, or Google Cloud Run
**Permanent URLs** Reliable endpoints for production services

### Example: Calendar Event to Image

Transform calendar events into professional images for team notifications:

```json
{
  "code": "Android Team Weekly Meeting\n8:30 am to 11:00 am\nBoard Room\nDiscussion about upcoming releases",
  "language": "text",
  "designSystem": "material",
  "title": "Team Meeting",
  "backgroundTheme": "chatgpt5"
}
```

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Repository** Push code to GitHub for automatic builds
2. **Container** Auto-build Docker images via GitHub Actions
3. **Cloud** Deploy to Railway or Render for instant URLs
4. **Integration** Use the permanent URL in your automation workflows
